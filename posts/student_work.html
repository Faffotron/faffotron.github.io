	<h2>Student Work</h2>
	<p>
		While studying Media Design at Victoria University of Wellington
		I made several creative coding sketches as part of my coursework.
		I also worked on some solo and group game projects.
		Here's a selection of them:

	<h3>Creative Coding Sketches</h3>

	<h3>Student Gamedev Work</h3>
		<h4 class="title">Hortus Hyalus</h4>
		<img
			src="/media/student_gamedev/HortusHyalus.gif"
			alt="A side-on slice of a digital terrarium with tiny flying creatures over hills and a body of water.">
		<p>
			This was a solo project for a Computer Graphics class.
			A small toroidal world is generated which the user can manipulate by moving tiles with their cursor.
			Plants slowly grow and spread across the landscape while small flittering creatures wander, graze on vegetation, reproduce, and eventually die.

		<h4 class="title">Heliostar</h4>
		<img
			src="/media/student_gamedev/Heliostar.png"
			alt="A green spaceship evading two red enemy ships around a black hole, in a colour-limited Game Boy style.">
		<p>
			A solo project for my Game Design classes.
			The player's green spaceship must evade pursuing red enemy ships around a swirling black hole in the middle of the play space,
			luring pursuers into being destroyed by the player's engine trail or the black hole.

		<h4 class="title">Knave</h4>
		<img
			src="/media/student_gamedev/Knave.png"
			alt="A cowled figure fleeing from an attacking knight in a castle dungeon.">
		<p>
			A platformer made as a group project for my Game Design classes.
			The player controls a cowled character to navigate and escape from a castle's dungeon,
			acquiring abilities as they explore which allow them to overcome previously impassable obstacles and evade enemies.
			I was responsible for programming the sprite animation system, character and object physics, enemy AI,
			camera point of interest system, and object interactions.
